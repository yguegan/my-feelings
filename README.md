# my-feelings

This project is an application allowing to catch the emotions of a user

This is composed on two parts one backend and one frontend part, you need to start both side to have the solution working, all informations are described on separate readme

The focus has been made on the technical side, the base is healthy and can allow more development on it and improvements. Due to the light experience on those technologies the TDD approach has
not been made here but the separation between the features and the componisation allow a flexibility of the features and make them reusable
